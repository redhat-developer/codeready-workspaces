### What's inside?

This repository hosts CodeReady Workspaces assembly that mainly inherits Eclipse Che artifacts and repackages some of them:

Differences as compared to upstream:

* Customized Dashboard (pics, icons, titles, loaders, links)
* Samples and Stacks modules
* Bayesian Language Server and agent
* Product Info plugin (IDE customizations: pics, titles links)
* Custom Dockerfile based on official RH OpenJDK image from RHCC

NOTE: Dockerfiles in this repo are NOT the ones used to build RHCC container images in OSBS.

### How to Build

#### Pre-reqs

JDK 1.8+
Maven 3.5+

#### Build Assembly

Run the following command in the root of a repository:

```
mvn clean install
```

NOTE: Since the build includes GWT compilation it may take more than 3 minutes to complete.

The build artifact used in the Docker image will be in `assembly/assembly-main/target/codeready-${version}/codeready-${version}`

### How to Build Container Image (Locally)

Run the following command in the root of a repository:

```
docker build -t ${REGISTRY}/${REPO} .
```

You can then reference this image in your deployment (set image pull policy to IfNotPresent to avoid pushing the image to a registry).

Please note, that stacks may reference non-existing images like `docker-registry.default.svc:5000/openshift/rhel-base-jdk8`. These images are built as a post installation step. Once published, they will be in locations like these:

* registry.access.redhat.com/codeready-workspaces/server:1.0.0
* registry.access.redhat.com/codeready-workspaces/server-apb:1.0.0
* registry.access.redhat.com/codeready-workspaces/stacks-cpp:1.0.0
* registry.access.redhat.com/codeready-workspaces/stacks-dotnet:1.0.0
* registry.access.redhat.com/codeready-workspaces/stacks-golang:1.0.0
* registry.access.redhat.com/codeready-workspaces/stacks-java:1.0.0
* registry.access.redhat.com/codeready-workspaces/stacks-java-rhel8-beta:1.0.0
* registry.access.redhat.com/codeready-workspaces/stacks-node:1.0.0
* registry.access.redhat.com/codeready-workspaces/stacks-php:1.0.0
* registry.access.redhat.com/codeready-workspaces/stacks-python:1.0.0


### How to Build Container Using NCL and OSBS
