# This folder contains the build process metadata for building:

* che-devfile-registry
* che-plugin-registry
* che-pluginbrokers

# Builds will:

* fetch 3rd party sources

* build 3rd party sources if required
** che-plugin-registry/Jenkinsfile-single is a pipeline for building and publishing any third party vsix extensions, that would be used in CRW plugin registry
** che-theia & dependencies, including any patches (if required)

* tar sources & binaries used in Brew build

* provide Dockerfile (semi-synced to pkgs.devel for use in Brew), which can be used to build the container locally

# Downstream, Brew builds must:

* apply changes to upstream Dockerfile to see Pulp repos and support Brew build process

* fetch 3rd party source/binary tarball, including patches

* push that tar to dist-git lookaside cache so it's available when running the Dockerfile build

* unpack the tar as part of the container build where required

* run a container build
