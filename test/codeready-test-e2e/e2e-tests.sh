Usage: ${CALLER} [-Mmode] [options] [tests scope]

Options:
    --http                              Use 'http' protocol to connect to product (default value)
    --https                             Use 'https' protocol to connect to product
    --host=<PRODUCT_HOST>               Set host where product is deployed, default is 'codeready-codeready.<IP>.nip.io'
    --port=<PRODUCT_PORT>               Set port of the product, default is 80

Modes (defines environment to run tests):
    -Mlocal                             All tests will be run in a Web browser on the developer machine.
                                        Recommended if test visualization is needed and for debugging purpose.

       Options that go with 'local' mode:
       --web-driver-version=<VERSION>    To use the specific version of the WebDriver, be default the latest will be used: "${WEBDRIVER_VERSION}"
       --web-driver-port=<PORT>          To run WebDriver on the specific port, by default: "${WEBDRIVER_PORT}"
       --threads=<THREADS>               Number of tests that will be run simultaneously. It also means the very same number of
                                        Web browsers will be opened on the developer machine.
                                        Default value is in range [2,5] and depends on available RAM.

    -Mgrid (default)                    All tests will be run in parallel among several docker containers.
                                        One container per thread. Recommended to run test suite.

        Options that go with 'grid' mode:
        --threads=<THREADS>             Number of tests that will be run simultaneously.
                                        Default value is in range [2,5] and depends on available RAM.

Define tests scope:
    --test=<TEST_CLASS>                 Single test/package to run.
                                        For example: '--test=DialogAboutTest', '--test=org.eclipse.che.selenium.git.**'.
    --suite=<SUITE>                     Test suite to run, found ('CodereadySuite.xml' is default one):
"$(for x in $(ls -1 target/test-classes/suites); do echo "                                            * "$x; done)"
    --exclude=<TEST_GROUPS_TO_EXCLUDE>  Comma-separated list of test groups to exclude from execution.
                                        For example, use '--exclude=github' to exclude GitHub-related tests.

Handle failing tests:
    --failed-tests                      Rerun failed tests that left after the previous try
    --regression-tests                  Rerun regression tests that left after the previous try
    --rerun [ATTEMPTS]                  Automatically rerun failing tests.
                                        Default attempts number is 1.

Other options:
    --help                              Display help information
    --debug                             Run tests in debug mode
    --skip-sources-validation           Fast build. Skips source validation and enforce plugins
    --workspace-pool-size=[<SIZE>|auto] Size of test workspace pool.
                                        Default value is 0, that means that test workspaces are created on demand.

HOW TO of usage:
    Run tests from 'CodereadySuite.xml' against locally deployed CodeReady Workspaces on OpenShift Origin in grid mode using HTTP protocol:
        ${CALLER}

    Test locally deployed CodeReady Workspaces on OpenShift Origin and automatically rerun failing tests:
        ${CALLER} --rerun [ATTEMPTS]

    Run single test or package of tests:
        ${CALLER} <...> --test=<TEST>

    Run suite:
        ${CALLER} <...> --suite=<PATH_TO_SUITE>

    Rerun failed tests:
        ${CALLER} <...> --failed-tests
        ${CALLER} <...> --failed-tests --rerun [ATTEMPTS]

    Debug selenium test:
        ${CALLER} -Mlocal --test=<TEST> --debug
