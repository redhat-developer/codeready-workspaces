== How to run End-To-End tests

==== 1. Run all tests against locally deployed CodeReady Workspaces on OpenShift Origin in grid mode

Simply launch `./e2e-tests.sh`

==== 2. Run tests with specified host and port of CodeReady Workspaces on OpenShift

Launch `./e2e-tests.sh --host=&lt;CodeReady Workspaces host on OpenShift&gt; --port=<port>`

The tests are running with default CodeReady Workspaces credentials:
Default values:

- OPENSHIFT_USERNAME: "developer"

- OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD: "any"

- CHE_OPENSHIFT_PROJECT: "codeready"

You can change it by using following system variables
```
export OPENSHIFT_USERNAME=<openshift_web_console_username>;
export OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD=<openshift_web_console_password>;
export OPENSHIFT_TOKEN=<openshift_web_console_bearer_auth_token>;
export CHE_OPENSHIFT_PROJECT=<namespace_of_codeready_workspaces_deployed_on_openshift>;
```
where `CHE_OPENSHIFT_PROJECT` is optional and is aimed to replace username/password when OpenShift is configured with oAuth.

==== 3. Setup test admin and test user credentials
Also you can set your own credentials of test user or admin instead of default ones
```
export CHE_ADMIN_NAME=<che_admin_name>
export CHE_ADMIN_EMAIL=<che_admin_email>
export CHE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<che_admin_password>

export CHE_TESTUSER_NAME=<che_test_user_name>
export CHE_TESTUSER_EMAIL=<che_test_user_email>
export CHE_TESTUSER_PASSWORD=<che_test_user_password>
```

Default values:

- CHE_ADMIN_NAME: "admin"

- CHE_ADMIN_EMAIL: "admin@admin.com"

- CHE_ADMIN_PASSWORD: "admin"

- CHE_OPENSHIFT_PROJECT: "codeready"

If test user credentials aren't set, tests create random test user.

== Run tests scenarios
==== Display help information
`./e2e-tests.sh --help`

==== Run tests from _CodereadySuite.xml_ against locally deployed CodeReady Workspaces on OpenShift Origin in grid mode using HTTP protocol
`./e2e-tests.sh`

==== Test locally deployed CodeReady Workspaces on OpenShift Origin and automatically rerun failing tests
`./e2e-tests.sh --rerun [ATTEMPTS]`

==== Run single test or package of tests
`./e2e-tests.sh --test=<TEST>`

==== Run suite
`./e2e-tests.sh --suite=<PATH_TO_SUITE>`

==== Rerun failed tests
```
./e2e-tests.sh --failed-tests
./e2e-tests.sh --failed-tests --rerun [ATTEMPTS]
```

==== Debug test

`./e2e-tests.sh -Mlocal --test=<TEST> --debug`

== Setup GitHub related tests execution

==== 1. Register GitHub oAuth application

Go to https://github.com/settings/applications/new[OAuth application page] and register a new application:

* `Application name` : `CodeReady`

* `Homepage URL` : `http://&lt;OPENSHIFT_SSO_SERVER_ADDRESS&gt;`

* `Authorization callback URL` : `http://&lt;OPENSHIFT_SSO_SERVER_ADDRESS&gt;/api/oauth/callback`
For OpenShift Origin it has the next format: `http://rh-sso-codeready.<IP>.nip.io/auth/realms/che/broker/github/endpoint`.


Then you should create GitHub identity provider in OpenShift SSO server like it described here https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/user-management.html#social-login-and-brokering.

==== 2. Configure End-To-End tests to run GitHub-related tests

GitHub related end-to-end tests run by default. You can exclude them from execution by using special parameter `-exclude=github`.

In case of running GitHub-related tests you need to define GitHub test users credentials. Set `CHE_LOCAL_CONF_DIR` environment variable
and point to the folder where end-to-end tests configuration will be stored. Then create file with `.properties` extension in that folder
with the following content:
```
# GitHub test users credentials
github.username=<MAIN_GITHUB_USERNAME>
github.password=<MAIN_GITHUB_PASSWORD>
github.auxiliary.username=<AUXILIARY_GITHUB_USERNAME>
github.auxiliary.password=<AUXILIARY_GITHUB_PASSWORD>
```

== Test development tips

It's impossible to use `@Test(dependsOnMethods)` to express dependency between the tests because it breaks parallel execution of test classes (an issue https://github.com/cbeust/testng/issues/1773)[https://github.com/cbeust/testng/issues/1773)].

`@Test(priority)` can be used instead, and dependent test will be skipped if preceding test with higher priority from the same test class has failed.
Set attribute `@Test(alwaysRun = true)` if test shouldn't be skipped in that case.

In case of testing workspaces created using stack images from quay.io or somewhere else you can define `Map[stack-image-address-prefix -> new-stack-image-address]` and store it as `src/test/resources/conf/stack-replacement.json`.
Example of map to quay.io latest tags could be found in `src/test/resources/conf/stack-replacement-quay-latest.json` file. It could be used for nightly testing when CRW is built using the nightly profile: `mvn clean install -P nightly`.
