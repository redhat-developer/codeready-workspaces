== How to run Performance tests with maven

**Command to run performance test in 2 threads:**

```
 mvn clean verify -Pperformance \
-Dcrw.protocol=http(s) \
-Dcrw.host="CRW_HOST" \
-Dcrw.sso.host="CRW_KEYCLOAK_HOST" \
-Dcrw.port=CRW_PORT \
-Dtest.threads=NUM_OD_THREADS(virtualusers)
-DjmeterScript=FILE_NAME_OF_TEST
```
For instance we have CRW which launched on the next address: http://codeready-codeready-default.apps.iokhrime-ocp.crew
and keycloak has been deployed here: http://keycloak-codeready-default.apps.iokhrime-ocp.crew. I this case -  we have next command:
`mvn clean verify -Pperformance -Dcrw.protocol=http -Dcrw.host=codeready-codeready-default.apps.iokhrime-ocp.crew -Dcrw.sso.host=keycloak-codeready-default.apps.iokhrime-ocp.crew -Dcrw.port=80 -Dtest.threads=1 -DjmeterScript=codeready-test-scenario-with-building-project.jmx`
------------
In the **codeready-test-scenario.jmx** file implemented next scenario:
* Creates virtual user(s)=amount of the treads (-Dtest.threads property)
* Each virtual user login and create a workspace
* Each virtual user waits workspace creation (RUNNING) status
* After creation the virtual user(s) stop the workspace and remove the workspace
* In the end - performs clean up actions in the separated Thredgroup, remove all users
----------------
IIn the **codeready-test-scenario-with-building-project.jmx** file implemented next scenario:
 * Creates virtual user(s)=amount of the treads (-Dtest.threads property)
 * Each virtual user login and create a workspace
 * Each virtual user waits workspace creation (RUNNING) status
 * Upload the default-spring-project.zip into each workspace
 * Launch build command in the workspace (run command like: `mvn clen install -f /projects/maven-project/default-spring-project)`
 * Parse output each 3 sec after finishing building stop and remove the workspace
------------------
In the **codeready-test-scenario-with-opening-file.jmx** file implemented next scenario:
* Creates virtual user(s)=amount of the treads (-Dtest.threads property)
* Each virtual user login and create a workspace
* Each virtual user waits workspace creation (RUNNING) status
* Upload the default-spring-project.zip into each workspace
* Open the pom.xml file from the current project
* Check that file has been opened properly (check expected content in the responce)
* After creation the virtual user(s) stop the workspace and remove the workspace
* In the end - performs clean up actions in the separated Threadgroup, remove all users
